# This function compiles software and creates a directory called pkg/ to install
# the software to. This allows makepkg to package files without having to sift
# through your file system. The first step in the build() function is to change
# into the directory created by uncompressing the source tarball. makepkg will
# change the current directory to $srcdir before executing the build() function.

# The final step is to put the compiled files in a directory where makepkg can
# retrieve them to create a package. The pkg directory replicates the hierarchy
# of the root file system of the software's installation paths. If you have to
# manually place files under the root of your filesystem, you should install them
# in the pkg directory under the same directory structure.
